Poiters uses 2 byes (platform specific) memory to store address of any basic data type or user defined data data.
If we Increase pointer(by 1) it gets pointed to next element of same type means it gets increamented(by 1) by size of data type it is pointing to.
Pointers are not strictly checked for out of bound memory access, so if any project is using pointers they should be used in framework of project where uses of them is wrapped with proper sequrity layer.
